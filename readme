This folder contains the code for the paper "Ranking and Selection in Large-Scale Inference of Heteroscedastic Units"
rih.R contains the main funcitons
rih.func implement the selection procedure described in Section 3
rvalue.func constructs r-values by varying FDR level
rvalue2.func constructs r-values by varying mu_0

3M.funcs.R, nest.func.R, rsorgen.R contains functions used by rih.R.
To replicate the result from say section 5.3 run "section5_3.R"
